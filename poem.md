# A Pre‑Gutenberg Ode to *1984*

The Last Victory

In the shadow of the iron sky,<br>
[Winston](https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Winston_Smith) sat, his heart a stone,<br>
The chestnut tree’s roots deep in the lie,<br>
Where a man must kneel, and call it home.<br><br>

The truth is broken, shattered wide,<br>
The whispers call, the echoes hide,<br>
But the heart of man, once proud and free,<br>
Now beats as one with the tyranny.<br><br>

He loved Big Brother, he loved Big Brother,<br>
A soul erased, the last breath smothered.<br>
The heart, the mind, the will, the name,<br>
All burned in the eternal flame.<br><br>

Remember the stars, the coral bright,<br>
[Winston](https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Winston_Smith) once dreamed of the morning light,<br>
But dreams were stolen, truths were bent,<br>
And there, inside, was where it went.<br><br>

The paperweight fell, the glass now dust,<br>
What was pure turned to bitter rust.<br>
His hands now shake, but his eyes are cold,<br>
For the Party’s truth is now his soul.<br><br>

He loved Big Brother, he loved Big Brother,<br>
A soul erased, the last breath smothered.<br>
The heart, the mind, the will, the name,<br>
All burned in the eternal flame.<br><br>

Once he fought, once he cried,<br>
For memories lost, for love denied,<br>
But now he sits in the café still,<br>
His heart bowed low to the Party’s will.<br><br>

The chestnut tree no longer whispers,<br>
The love he sought, the hope that flickers,<br>
Gone, erased, like dust in the air,<br>
Big Brother reigns, and [Winston](https://classic-literature.fandom.com/wiki/Winston_Smith)'s there.<br><br>

He loved Big Brother, he loved Big Brother,<br>
A soul erased, the last breath smothered.<br>
The heart, the mind, the will, the name,<br>
All burned in the eternal flame.
