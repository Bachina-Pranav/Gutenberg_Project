# A Pre‑Gutenberg Ode to *1984*

O telescreens dim and whispers thin,
Through dusty streets your truth blows in.
The tyrant’s gaze, the doubter’s fears—
All scribed on minds, yet lost to ears.

In parchment night Winston dares write;
A fragile spark defies the blight.
But voice alone must guard the lore—
Before the print, before *Nineteen‑Eighty‑Four*.
